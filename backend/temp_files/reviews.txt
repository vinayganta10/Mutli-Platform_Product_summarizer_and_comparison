My review :Performance [ 4/5 ] - Gaming Performance good but you'll see some frame drops and lag somewhere while using but a great gaming experience at this price.Camera [ 3/5 ] - Very limit features in camera app and quality is also not good and you'll find better options in market at 20k.Battery [ 5/5 ] - Awesome battery life and 80w fast charging is crazy and will take about 40m-60m for 0-100%.Display [ 4.5/5 ] - Good display quality in this price segment.Software [ 4/5 ] - Somewhere a decent ui experience but if you are looking for a good ui then Samsung ofc will be the best option.Conclusion - If you are looking for a phone for normal use and don't use camera that much then it's a great choice but OnePlus as a company is not offering you something special  if you buy at by seeing their brand value and it's quite similar to Realme Mobiles.
