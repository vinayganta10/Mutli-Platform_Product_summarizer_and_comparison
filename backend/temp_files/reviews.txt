I'm a filmmaker I was looking for a pro grade camera so my first tilt was the 15 pro but my entire workflow is based of windows and Tab S9 Ultra... but waited till the announcement of 16 pro series and then decided to get this... so I got thisGalaxy S24 UltraThe looks and design are eye catching especially the Titanium outdoors look so lovely my most favorite colorThe camera is so capable if you use it with the black magic camera app... (the stock camera app is still better than the others though) paired with the anamorphic lens clip I got some stunning footage was really surprised to see how a few shots turned out to be...Also the tap and hold for slo-mo in the gallery is a good feature it works seamlessly 8/10 times...The battery life is rock solid even after a heavy recording day... it still has some 35% of juice left by 10pmThe Anti reflective screen is a crazy good and I'd say every device manufacturer should copy this for their own good...Speakers: rock solidOne UI is getting better every month...The SPen really helped me a lot...I just hope Samsung brings more accessories to IndiaFinally I feel it's worth it but still try to get the best deal from all stores...

Costly font only camera is outstanding.. s pen have some advantage but no more use of taking notes like diary or etc . UI also not better than one ui of one plus. No alert slider . Data saver mode stopped Hotspot. Low sound and worst battery and also charging speed poor. Not worth more than 50k. Bulky also.

I purchased this phone in month of May 2024. I am also using iPhone 11 pro max as it is my trusted companion.Coming to cameras - while cam quality is good but it needs massive improvement especially in low light conditions and in 200mp view the cam doesn't understand lighting conditions well. An improvement is planned but since 4 months there is no cam update.My old iPhone 4k video recording is much superior than s24 4k video recording.Display- full marks for brightness.  It gets so bright that it can literally cause light hallucinations for sometime. At night you can set it to 0 and even have some brightness left.Comparing to my older iPhone 11 pro max the display quality feels more or less same.Gaming - while I don't play games a lot but on occasion do play diablo immortal.  The phone heats up and it lags. Imagine my 11 pro max runs it better. I think processor is not doing justice and needs improvement.Battery - professional battery hogger. It drinks battery like fish in water. Need to set display as auto refresh. Battery could have last better.Half Value for money- nope. At this price a lot of things are expected. I additionally bought 2 years of warranty. But I feel out of 10 value for money is 5.
