The Realme Narzo 70 Turbo that I recently purchased has beyond my expectations! Because of the strong processor and lots of RAM, the performance is quite smooth, allowing me to multitask and play games without experiencing any latency. The vivid and clear display makes it ideal for browsing or viewing movies. With heavy use, the battery lasts an easy full day, and the fast charging feature comes in handy when I'm pressed for time. For the budget range, the camera quality is excellent, producing crisp and colourful images. All things considered, the Narzo 70 Turbo is a fantastic option for anyone searching for a powerful yet affordable smartphone because of its outstanding value!

Every thing is good. Unnecessary gaming apps has installed which has no mean. Looks, camera battery back up, performance all are perfectly working.Budget friendly phone in this segment.But security and system updates are only for 2 years which is very disappointing.Rest is OKey.

First time buyer of Realme brand mobile.  I'm not a gamer but wanted a good performance based phone for day to day usage with good battery life and a long time operation.Bought this phone on the first sale itself and used it for 10 days for now in all situations (i.e. heat, rain, cold conditions).Realme made a phone with a fantastic 7300 processor which is performing very well with no heating issues (its really super cool in day to day operation and getting warm under gaming conditions), smooth operation and surprisingly good UI and software. Very good battery life with around 9 hours SOT.  45W superfast Charger been included in the package and the charging time is around 1 hours 15 minutes. They have really tuned the phone very well.The camera is okay for day to day use.  Camera needs an update because, it has a good 50 MP sensor, but the algorithm needed to be worked upon to reach its potential. I'm just a casual gamer, but the gaming performance of this phone is wonderfully good. For a budget to get such a performance phone is truly appreciated.The 120Hz 4K OLED eSports display is stunningly beautiful with colours been so vivid and bright.  The 4K videos are visually stunning with stereo speakers doing its job very well. The sound is loud and clear.The call quality is quite good too and they have included the Clear Voice noise cancelling feature built in, so our voice is clear and loud to the other person and this feature is working very well.As far as the Realme UI software is concerned, there were a lot of bloatware included but we can uninstall all of them easily. That's the only major con I find on the software side.I am coming from using the Mi UI, Hyper OS, but the Realme UI 5 is good too with a lot of good features and tune ups are available for each element of the UI.  But they're not organized easily, so little irritating., But the patience is worth it. Also check out the Realme Labs section which has some interesting features listed and more to come. For now, they have a heart rate measurement feature using the finger print scanner which is very good to use and accurate as well.Last but not the least, the design of the phone is truly different and it looks fantastic under the bright light. The yellow color attracts eyes everywhere. Let's see how the updates and support from realme is in future.Don't fall for the FPS thingy talked about by Reviewers. Most of the regular users like me, don't care about it. All I need was a good phone with good features, day long good battery life with no heating issues.  Realme Narzo 70 Turbo scores very well in all these sections.  To make it a fantastic phone, this phone needs a little fine tuning on the camera side and animation side in future updates. If realme can do it, then it'll be hard to beat under 15 K category.For now, its a steal deal.P.S. Request to realme to fine tune a little the camera performance, few glitches in software side please. It'll make one of the best phones under 15K.
