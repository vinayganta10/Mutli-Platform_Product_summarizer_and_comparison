It is good phone in this price range. It can do basic task with ease.- Build quality is good.- Phone screen is huge(I am not big fan of huge screens though).- Supports all basic functions with some casual gaming.- Filled with many pre installed apps.- Don't expect too much with camera.- Sound is loud enough.- Charging take 90-120 mins.- Fingerprint sensor is less sensitive (my view)- Heats while charging and Gaming.I think purpose of this phone is for day to day calling with smartphone features of internet browsing, payments, YouTube, etc. It does well in that area.
